Leave notes and paper cards at home and learn a foreign language anywhere with aWords.

### Plan

1. Flutter - web, aurora (android, ios).
2. Dictionaries - [FreeDict](https://freedict.org/).
3. API - authorization, registration, statistics, share access to cards and statistics.
4. The ability to create your own list with the words.
5. Sharing your lists with others both privately and publicly.
6. Modes: pictures, native-words, words to learn, by description.
7. The user's progress can be share to users.
8. Children's mode - cute text etc...
