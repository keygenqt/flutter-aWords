===================

An experimental project on Dart/Flutter that implements one entire application ecosystem. 
The project is in development, I’m not sure it will be finished - it’s not a rewarding task to write websites and APIs in Dart/Flutter;
there are more convenient tools.

**Used:** [Dart](https://dart.dev/) & [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

### Feature
